Unit 4 Programming / Problem set 5 / Question 3
Python 3.9.0

Description
This program will run the ancient Chinese Game of Nim. The program will choose a number of stones between 15 and 30 as
two players swap turns taking their choice of 1, 2, or 3 stones from the lot. The player that is forced to take up the
last stone loses the game. Players can not intentionally choose to take the last stone, if not compulsory. This program
will allow the option to play multiplayer or single player. The single player mode will also have two levels of
difficulty that may be played. The first difficulty completes the basic gameplay, as the program will select stones at
random, while making sure not to violate the rules of the game. The second difficulty is harder, and the program follows
an algorithm to ensure that it will win whenever possible. Multiplayer mode will be able to be played by two players
on the same device.

Assumptions
To run this program a version of python 3.0.0 or greater is needed.

Features
I have added a main menu for an integrated UI, a rule book, two single player difficulties, a multiplayer difficulty,
also integrated on-line documentation.

Restrictions
This progam will not refresh counted wins for players in multiplayer, or single players in single player mode, or computer
wins in single player mode, unless the code is terminated and reran. This progam's UI is oriented around travel throughout
the main menu: thus, all loops are infinite, unless quit is typed or exit is selected within the main menu. To change game modes
navigation through main menu is necessary.

No known errors.
No implementation details necessary.
No additional files needed.
