# pythonGameOfNim
This program will run the ancient Chinese Game of Nim. The program will choose a number of stones between 15 and 30 as
two players swap turns taking their choice of 1, 2, or 3 stones from the lot. The player that is forced to take up the
last stone loses the game. Players can not intentionally choose to take the last stone, if not compulsory. This program
will allow the option to play multiplayer or single player. The single player mode will also have two levels of
difficulty that may be played. The first difficulty completes the basic gameplay, as the program will select stones at
random, while making sure not to violate the rules of the game. The second difficulty is harder, and the program follows
an algorithm to ensure that it will win whenever possible. Multiplayer mode will be able to be played by two players
on the same device.
